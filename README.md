## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor 

### What I learned

I've learned that is a better practice to use the a anchor tag <a> instead the button tag <button> when the button opens a new web tab o it is used to navigate in the same web page.

Also, I started to use Sass. In this project learned  about variables, maps, nesting and mixin.

### Continued development

I'm going to keep using Sass to improve the topics I've learned in this project and know about new ones. 

### Useful resources

- [Free Code Camp Sass Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs) - This tutorial helped me a lot because explain the principle Sass concepts and the project example made it easier for me to work in this challenge.
